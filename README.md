# Jurisprudence Semantic Search Framework

This repository aims to reproduce all work from my [master's thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ZPYt94DdkMGd2I7hXkwi6o6qnQ9B0aa/view?usp=sharing).

It is still incomplete, nevertheless, I am actively working on the maintenance 
and functionality of the code.

For the repository to be complete, the following tasks should be addressed:

### Code improvements

- [ ] Add complete descriptions to all functions
- [ ] Add Type Hints to all functions

### Repository completeness
- [ ] Add remaining models (Word2Vec, Doc2vec, Transformer)
- [ ] Store vectors in PostgreSQL for faster vector operations
- [ ] Create a simple application that works as a search engine
